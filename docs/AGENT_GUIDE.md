- **task_list**: Action items and implementation steps
- **spec**: Technical specifications
- **copy**: Marketing and content copy
- **log**: Execution logs and metadata

### Artifact Metadata

Each artifact includes metadata:

- **Provider**: The AI provider used (e.g., "google")
- **Model**: The specific AI model (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash")
- **Usage Stats**: Token counts, latency, costs (when available)

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Complete Project Information

The better your project details, the better the agent outputs.

**Essential fields**:

- **Project Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what your project does
- **Sector**: Choose the most relevant sector
- **Project Type**: SaaS, Web App, Mobile App, etc.

### 2. Use Agents in Sequence

For best results, run agents in this order:

1. **Design Spec Agent** - Get the big picture
2. **Workflow Designer Agent** - Plan the technical details
3. **Content Strategist Agent** - Prepare your marketing

### 3. Review and Iterate

Agent outputs are starting points, not final deliverables:

- Review all generated content carefully
- Adapt suggestions to your specific context
- Use the "Wizard" to refine your project details
- Re-run agents after making significant changes

### 4. Save Important Artifacts

- Download or copy critical content to your project management tools
- Use artifacts as templates for your own documents
- Share agent outputs with your team for feedback
